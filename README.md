# CPSC 368 Research Paper

# Introduction

This research project investigates the difference in the relationship between **health expenditure per capita** and **average cancer mortality** between **developed** and **developing** countries. And the relationship between lifestyle factors—**tobacco use**, **alcohol consumption**, and **obesity rates**—and the **prevalence of liver cancer** during the COVID-19 pandemic.
